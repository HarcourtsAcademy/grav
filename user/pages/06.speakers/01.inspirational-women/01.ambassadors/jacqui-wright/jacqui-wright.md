  profile: |
            I joined Harcourts in 2004 and was previously in the role of New Zealand Academy Support. I am now in the international role of Academy Marketing Manager for New Zealand and I am based in our Christchurch office.

            I am responsible for the design all Harcourts Academy training materials which include textbook and workbook covers, training room posters, Academy graphics and all Academy advertising materials. I also oversees our social media platforms, primarily Facebook and I am frequently contacting our trainers for fun in-training photos and testimonials.

            I am also Executive Assistant to Harcourts Chairman of the Board, Paul Wright.
