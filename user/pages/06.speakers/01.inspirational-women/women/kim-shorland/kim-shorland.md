            Kim&rsquo;s desire to own a real estate agency from the age of 11 was a dream that she hunted down and achieved by the age of 22.  Owning and running her office and combining that with bringing her two children in to the world and growing a team, made for some interesting and uncertain times.  Kim speaks openly about the emotional and financial challenges, self-belief and her uncompromising importance of values to break through to where she is today.
