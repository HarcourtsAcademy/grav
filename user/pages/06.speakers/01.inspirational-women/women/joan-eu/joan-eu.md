  profile: |
            Joan, who came to Australia from Singapore in the 1970s, has a successful business background in the healthfood industry coupled with a fine track record for achieving outstanding results in real estate sales since 1997.

            Real estate, Joan says, is all about working with people, not selling bricks and mortar. Joan has never lost sight of the fact that any real estate transaction, regardless of the location, size or value of the property, involves the most important decisions people make during their lifetime and works closely with them through this often stressful time.

            A good listener, Joan’s warm nature and friendly approach have contributed significantly to the reputation she has earned for being one of the most professional and successful real estate agents. As a member of the professional and international Harcourts brand, Joan is able to offer her clients the most advanced resources in the industry and to consistently develop her own skills through the company’s excellent training.

            Joan’s primary objective is to present the best skills and support services available in real estate today to assist her clients in achieving the best results.
