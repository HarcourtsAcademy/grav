  profile: |
            Sarah Sheppard (nee: Williams) has been an employee of the Brock Harcourts group since the beginning of 2001. During this time she has rubbed shoulders with some of Adelaide&rsquo;s best real estate sales consultants so it comes as no surprise after having already spent 15 years in the industry and majority of that time with the market leaders that she is an award winning consultant in her own right. As a result Sarah is also extremely knowledgeable having sold many residential homes, vacant land, assisted with sub-divisions and other wealth creating projects involving real estate. Sarah counts integrity and honesty as her most cherished values and her outstanding results speak volumes for the dedication she believes her clients deserve. Her open personality and optimistic approach go well with her genuine interest in people, and real estate.

#            Kim&rsquo;s desire to own a real estate agency from the age of 11 was a dream that she hunted down and achieved by the age of 22.  Owning and running her office and combining that with bringing her two children in to the world and growing a team, made for some interesting and uncertain times.  Kim speaks openly about the emotional and financial challenges, self-belief and her uncompromising importance of values to break through to where she is today.
