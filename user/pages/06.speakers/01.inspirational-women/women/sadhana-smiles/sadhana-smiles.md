            Sadhana speaks of her Fijian upbringing and her ongoing connection through her work to ensure Fijian women are screened for early cancer detection. Adopting 5 Fijian children to add to her own family is a wonderful example of the heart this woman has.

A truly inspirational Harcourts woman.
