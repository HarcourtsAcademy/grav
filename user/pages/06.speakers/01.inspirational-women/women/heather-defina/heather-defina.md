            My journey with Harcourts began in 1999. I needed to be successful, and I needed to get there fast, as I had four children to support, alone. With the many challenges I faced throughout my sales career, there was always someone in Harcourts to offer support.

            How lucky I chose Harcourts, as they have given me a vehicle to further my learning, and an extension to my family.

            My work has become one of the most important parts of my life. My children have been impacted in a very positive way, through my experiences with this company.

            Building connections with wonderful people, and especially seeing other women push through their challenges and find success and happiness, has been the most rewarding experience of my career.

            The &lsquo;story&rsquo; is about the lessons learned and strategies used to prosper in real estate and survive as a parent.

            With 4 children my sole responsibility and 6 with shared responsibility who visited every school holiday, time management and focusing
            on priorities was paramount. It&rsquo;s about knowing I couldnâ€™t have it all, and being happy and fulfilled with that.

            Key messages/lessons
            * Switching Channels
            * Get Up, Dress Up, Show Up
            * One Step at a Time
            * Don&rsquo;t Sweat the Small Stuff
