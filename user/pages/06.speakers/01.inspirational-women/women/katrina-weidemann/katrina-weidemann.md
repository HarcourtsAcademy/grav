  profile: |
            With an excellent grounding in communication and customer service skills, Katrina has a passion for Property Management and has consistently improved the Business Development aspect of Harcourts Ballarat, by increasing the Property Management Portfolio organically by more than 20% over the past 12 months simply through offering unparalleled service to clients in her role as Department Manager.

            Katrina is extremely competent, always tough but fair, and constantly applies herself in a calm & empathetic manner, when managing the rental needs of Landlord’s Investment Properties entrusted to her care on their behalf.

            At Harcourts we understand that Property Management is not purely about collecting rent, but maximising your dollar return by ensuring the best possible tenant is sourced to provide a long and stable Lease Agreement with minor interruptions to your property/investment.

            Katrina is always available 24/7 and says she never switches her phone off! Along with her work colleagues, those who deal with Katrina, quickly establish that she is reliable and trustworthy. Her motto is “I always do what I SAY I will do, WHEN I say I will do it!”

            Katrina has been awarded the prestigious title of No.1 Top Property Manager in Australia for the Harcourts Group for the last 3 consecutive years. A coveted award presented to only those who have excelled in a major way within Property Management businesses, achieving excellence.
