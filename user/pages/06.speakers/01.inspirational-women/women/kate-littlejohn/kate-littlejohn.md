            In my role as Business Operations Manager for Harcourts I assist Tony with the growth of the Harcourts brand throughout the state. This involves providing assistance with setting up new offices, branding requirements, technology, staffing, implementing systems and procedures and anything else that a new office joining the ever expanding Harcourts Group in Tasmania needs.

            This role allows me to deal directly with the people that will help to grow the Harcourts Group to be the number one real estate company in the state â€“ which I am very excited about! I enjoy the fact that I have a mix of administration based responsibilities in this role along with actually getting to meet the people and physically assisting with the day to day operations of a business.
