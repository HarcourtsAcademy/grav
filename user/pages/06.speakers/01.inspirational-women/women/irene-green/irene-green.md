            Beginning with Harcourts as a real estate business owner Irene and husband Mike were the number 1 franchise for New Zealand. Moving to Australia in 1997 the duo began the global expansion of Harcourts and ultimately purchased the company with partner Paul Wright in 2000.

            Irene believed a strong focus on growing their people would be their point of difference and has been an integral part of Harcourts Academy for over 25 years introducing successful and diverse programmes in Harcourts training rooms across 10 countries as well as online.

            As Head of the Academy Irene was the driving force behind becoming a Registered Training Organisation in Australia in 2004 and developing affiliations with industry training providers in New Zealand, South Africa and Indonesia.

            As Harcourts continues to grow Irene is responsible for the induction of new countries and works closely with the Harcourts Heads of Department and new corporate teams as well as travelling frequently to support our existing operations dotted around the globe.

            Inducted into the Harcourts Hall of Fame in 2013 for outstanding contribution Irene continues to champion international projects such as Harcourts Inspirational Women, Harcourts Future Leaders and our corporate One Team Leadership training programme.

            Irene holds a diploma in teaching, a diploma in workplace education and a diploma in business (real estate).
  message: |
            Irene shares her journey with Harcourts as a franchise owner, Head of academy and one of the owners of the Harcourts organization that she and husband Mike took off shore from New Zealand to expand throughout the world. She speaks openly about the challenges of being a woman in leadership married to the Harcourts International Managing Director, the guilt of being a full time working mum and the price she paid in her attempts to have it all.
