  profile: |
            I am one of the Directors of Harcourts Mandurah, in recent years I was a Licensee, a position I relinquished to concentrate solely on my number one love in the business – listing and selling Real Estate. My passion is people and my motto is “A client today is a client for life” and this drives my commitment and dedication to service. My high level of repeat and referral business is testament to this.

            I feel the key to my success is having the balance between the love of real estate and the love and support of family and friends. I am lucky enough to have a very supportive husband and 3 amazing sons. This career has given me so many opportunities.

            The opportunity to give back to an industry that has given me so many different things would be a privilege.

            Clare speaks openly and honestly about her life and the impact of the many events that happened throughout that shaped her into the person she is today, including her journey through real estate from administration to property management to sales and now to business ownership. She talks about family, about the guilt of being a full time working mum weighing against the passion and love of a great career and how to create balance and compromise to achieve a happy life. Clare urges us to take advantage of opportunities because if you don’t have a go you will never know! In closing Clare discusses surrounding yourself with the right people and the power of positivity.
