            I’m a firm believer in striving to be better tomorrow than I am today.

            When I was young, that meant spending hours training in the pool.

            Now, my personal challenge is long distance running. In the past five years, I’ve competed in marathons in New York, Paris, Tokyo and Auckland – and I’m pleased to say I’ve beaten my personal best every time.

            It’s the same with my career. I’ve worked in real estate for 26 years and am currently managing director of a fast growing business on South Australia’s beautiful South Coast. While I know vision and hard work are key contributors to our success, I also know that our growth owes more to the team of people we work with and who deliver on our vision every day.

            The one thing I enjoy most is mentoring the people around me – helping them to reach their personal and professional goals by being better tomorrow than they are today!
