Powerful beyond measure.

===

![](inspirational-women.png)

## Compelling Reasons.
1. To encourage and help the many women in Harcourts to share their stories, their lessons learned building a real estate career whilst juggling the demands of family and personal expectations.
2. To help our women be courageous and understand their value to the many young women in our organisation looking for role models, mentors and advice.
3. To provide a sense of belonging and sisterhood within Harcourts that will act as a magnet for other inspirational women to belong to.

> &ldquo;Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.&rdquo;
