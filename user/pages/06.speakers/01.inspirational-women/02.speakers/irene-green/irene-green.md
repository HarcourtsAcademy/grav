            Irene shares her journey with Harcourts as a franchise owner, Head of academy and one of the owners of the Harcourts organization that she and husband Mike took off shore from New Zealand to expand throughout the world. She speaks openly about the challenges of being a woman in leadership married to the Harcourts International Managing Director, the guilt of being a full time working mum and the price she paid in her attempts to have it all.
