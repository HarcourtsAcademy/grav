  profile: |
            I am relatively new to the real estate industry joining the Harcourts Tasmania team in 2014 as State Executive Administrator. I work closely with CEO Tony Morrison and the entire state team. I act as support for the 22 Harcourts office’s throughout Tasmania and coordinate the statewide events. I am also the Harcourts Foundation Ambassador for Tasmanian.

            With my marketing and events background I have brought new ideas to the team and I love being part of a dynamic team and leading business. I live on a beautiful farm in northern Tasmania and enjoy the balance (juggle!) of farm, family (with two little people) and Harcourts.

            The one thing I enjoy most is mentoring the people around me – helping them to reach their personal and professional goals by being better tomorrow than they are today!
