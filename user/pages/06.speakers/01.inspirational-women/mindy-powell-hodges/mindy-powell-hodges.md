            Ambition and fulfilment are strange bedfellows for women.

            I started my working life in the United States running the family Thoroughbred Stud and at 18 I started my own business within the thoroughbred industry, by 22 was the first in the United States to hold an executive position that had historically been held by men. Having shaken up the racing industry with gender equality I accepted an invitation from the Royal family in the United Arab Emirate as the Directory of Publicity and Marketing of the Equestrian and Racing Federation. A job that completely changed my life because there I met my wonderful husband and we created a family. This is where fulfilment can get in the way of ambition, having said that I enjoy parenthood and all that it offers.

            When we decided to live in Sydney, I thought what a fantastic opportunity to start with a career change. I wanted something that used my accomplished skill set, but offered different challenges all of which I have found in real estate. When I started in real estate I believe I could have benefitted tremendously if I had, had access to an organisation that offered practical advice and valuable support. So to be invited to take part in this exciting opportunity helping women balance ambition and fulfilment I feel truly blessed.
