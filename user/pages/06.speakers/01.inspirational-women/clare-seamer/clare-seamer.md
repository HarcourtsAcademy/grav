  profile: |
            I am one of the Directors of Harcourts Mandurah, in recent years I was a Licensee, a position I relinquished to concentrate solely on my number one love in the business – listing and selling Real Estate. My passion is people and my motto is “A client today is a client for life” and this drives my commitment and dedication to service. My high level of repeat and referral business is testament to this.

            I feel the key to my success is having the balance between the love of real estate and the love and support of family and friends. I am lucky enough to have a very supportive husband and 3 amazing sons. This career has given me so many opportunities.

            The opportunity to give back to an industry that has given me so many different things would be a privilege.
