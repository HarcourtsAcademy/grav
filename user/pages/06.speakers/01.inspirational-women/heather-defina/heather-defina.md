            My journey with Harcourts began in 1999. I needed to be successful, and I needed to get there fast, as I had four children to support, alone. With the many challenges I faced throughout my sales career, there was always someone in Harcourts to offer support.

            How lucky I chose Harcourts, as they have given me a vehicle to further my learning, and an extension to my family.

            My work has become one of the most important parts of my life. My children have been impacted in a very positive way, through my experiences with this company.

            Building connections with wonderful people, and especially seeing other women push through their challenges and find success and happiness, has been the most rewarding experience of my career.
