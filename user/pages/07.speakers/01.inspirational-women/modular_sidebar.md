Powerful beyond measure.

## A message from our founder
![Irene Green](irene.jpg?derivatives=300,600,100&sizes=%28max-width%3A23em%29+100vw%2C%28max-width%3A60em%29+30vw%2C+20vw){.inline-left}
I have been blessed to have strong role models, mentors and positive influence in my life. I wear a necklace of thirteen diamonds in memory of the year 2013 when my father died, my mentor Nelson Mandela died and I was inducted into the Harcourts Hall of Fame. Also that year a young woman decided not to give up on her dream to have a career in real estate because of something I said that inspired her to keep going in her struggle to succeed as well as raise a young child.

I realised that ordinary hard working women like me could make a difference for the women of Harcourts. We may not be professional speakers but we have important stories to share of how we faced the challenges they now face. We may not be famous but we are extraordinary in our accomplishments and the life lessons we have learned.  We can provide practical advice and valuable support that may help other women to succeed, to keep trying, to take more opportunities, to be proud of themselves.  
In May 2016 we launched Harcourts Inspirational women.  I am grateful to the wonderful ambassadors who drive this in their regions. We shall continue to inspire other women to know that they are powerful beyond measure.

> &ldquo; Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.&rdquo;

## Compelling Reasons.
1. To encourage and help the many women in Harcourts to share their stories, their lessons learned building a real estate career whilst juggling the demands of family and personal expectations.
2. To help our women be courageous and understand their value to the many young women in our organisation looking for role models, mentors and advice.
3. To provide a sense of belonging and sisterhood within Harcourts that will act as a magnet for other inspirational women to belong to.
